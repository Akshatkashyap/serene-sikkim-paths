# Gallery Visitor Features Implementation Summary

This document outlines the implementation of the Gallery Visitor section features that have been added to the Serene Sikkim Paths project.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Load More Photos (MonasteryGallery.tsx)

**Feature**: Dynamic loading of additional photos in the gallery
**Implementation**:
- Added `displayedImages` state to control how many images are shown (initially 4)

- Implemented `handleLoadMore()` function to increase displayed images by 4
- Added conditional rendering of "Load More Photos" button
- Shows remaining count in the button text
- Displays "Showing all X photos" message when all images are visible

**Key Code Changes**:
```typescript
const [displayedImages, setDisplayedImages] = useState(4);
const visibleImages = filteredImages.slice(0, displayedImages);
const hasMoreImages = displayedImages < filteredImages.length;

const handleLoadMore = () => {
  setDisplayedImages((prev) => Math.min(prev + 4, filteredImages.length));
};
```

### 2. Add Photos Button (MonasteryGallery.tsx)

**Feature**: Allow users to upload new images to the gallery
**Implementation**:
- Added file input with multiple image selection support
- Added "Add Photos" button with upload icon
- Implemented `handleFileUpload()` function to process selected images
- Uses FileReader API to convert files to base64 for display
- Automatically assigns metadata to uploaded images
- Includes upload loading state with spinning icon

**Key Code Changes**:
```typescript
const [isUploading, setIsUploading] = useState(false);
const fileInputRef = useRef<HTMLInputElement>(null);

const handleFileUpload = (event: React.ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement>) => {
  // Process files and add to gallery
  const newImage: GalleryImage = {
    id: `user_${Date.now()}_${Math.random().toString(36).substr(2, 9)}`,
    url: e.target?.result as string,
    title: file.name.split(".")[0] || "User Upload",
    photographer: getCurrentUserName(),
    // ... other properties
  };
};
```

### 3. View All Reviews (MonasteryRating.tsx)

**Feature**: Expandable view for all visitor reviews with detailed information
**Implementation**:
- Enhanced Rating interface to include review text and helpful votes

- Fixed modal positioning and z-index issues

**Key Code Changes**:
```typescript
interface Rating {
  userId: string;
  userName: string;
  rating: number;
  timestamp: Date;
  review?: string;
  helpful: number;
  isHelpful: boolean;
}

const reviewsWithText = ratings.filter(
  (rating) => rating.review && rating.review.trim().length > 0,
);

// Dialog component for viewing all reviews
<Button
  variant="outline"
  size="sm"
  onClick={() => setShowReviewsModal(true)}
  className="text-monastery-red hover:bg-monastery-red hover:text-white"
>
  <Eye className="h-4 w-4 mr-1" />
  View All Reviews ({reviewsWithText.length})
</Button>

{/* Custom Modal Implementation */}
{showReviewsModal && (
  <div className="fixed inset-0 z-50 flex items-center justify-center p-4">
    <div className="fixed inset-0 bg-black/50" onClick={() => setShowReviewsModal(false)} />
    <div className="relative bg-background rounded-lg max-w-4xl w-full max-h-[90vh]">
      {/* Full review list with interactions */}
    </div>
  </div>
)}
```

### 4. Load More Comments (MonasteryComments.tsx)

const hasMoreComments = displayedComments < comments.length;

const handleLoadMoreComments = () => {
  setDisplayedComments((prev) => Math.min(prev + 3, comments.length));
};
```

## Enhanced User Experience Features

### 1. Review Input System
- Added optional review textarea when users rate monasteries
- Appears when user hovers over stars to rate

### 3. Review Interaction System
- "Helpful" voting on reviews
- Review preview cards in main rating component
- Comprehensive review dialog with timestamps and user avatars
- Review sorting by recency

### 4. Progressive Loading UI
- Consistent loading patterns across gallery and comments

- Button text that includes context (remaining count)

## Technical Implementation Details

### State Management
- All data is stored in localStorage for persistence
- Components use React hooks for state management
- Proper TypeScript typing for all data structures
- useCallback optimization for performance
- Custom modal state management for reliable View All Reviews functionality

### UI/UX Considerations
- Responsive design maintained across all features
- Consistent styling with existing design system
- Loading states and user feedback
- Accessibility considerations (keyboard navigation, screen readers)

### Performance Optimizations
- Progressive loading reduces initial render time
- Image uploads processed asynchronously
- Lazy loading of review content
- Efficient re-rendering through proper state management
- Custom modal implementation to avoid third-party dialog issues

## File Modifications Summary

1. **MonasteryGallery.tsx**: Added photo upload and load more functionality
2. **MonasteryComments.tsx**: Enhanced with progressive comment loading  
3. **MonasteryRating.tsx**: Expanded to full review system with custom modal implementation

## Bug Fixes Applied

- **View All Reviews Issue**: Replaced Radix Dialog component with custom modal implementation to ensure reliable functionality
- **TypeScript Issues**: Fixed all type errors with proper interface definitions
- **useEffect Dependencies**: Resolved React Hook warnings with useCallback optimization
- **Modal Positioning**: Ensured proper z-index and overlay behavior for review modal

All implementations maintain backward compatibility and integrate seamlessly with the existing codebase while providing enhanced visitor engagement features.
